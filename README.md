# PBM
This Git includes MATLAB files related to the mechanstic model propoesed for purple bactria growth in an open raceway reactor.
The model is described in the paper entitled "A mechanistic model for operation and control of purple phototrophic raceway reactors: microbial selection dynamics and wastewater treatment performance".

PBM.m is the model function, and to run it, Run_PBM.m should be run.

Supplementary-material includes parameters used in the model.
