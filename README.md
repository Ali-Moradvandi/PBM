# PBM
This Git includes MATLAB files related to the mechanstic model propoesed for purple bactria growth in an open raceway reactor.
The model is described in the paper entitled "A novel mechanistic modelling approach for microbial selection dynamics: towards improved design and control of raceway reactors for purple bacteria".

PBM.m is the model function, and to run it, Run_PBM.m should be run.

Supplementary-material includes the parameter values used in the PBM.
